    <h3>Rassia Ukraine</h3>
    <p>Russia invaded Ukraine in a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which had started in 2014. The invasion,
      the
      largest and deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II,[14][15][16] has caused hundreds of thousands of
      military
      casualties and tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilian casualties. As of 2024, Russian troops occupy about 20% of
      Ukraine. From a population of 41 million, about 8 million Ukrainians had been internally displaced and more than 8.2
      million had fled the country by April 2023, creating Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II.
    The Kumbh Mela is not just a festival—it’s a monumental gathering of spirituality, faith, and cultural unity. In 2025,
    millions of devotees from around the world will converge at Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, to partake in the Maha Kumbh
    Mela,one of the most significant religious events in Hinduism. This sacred event occurs every 12 years and is rooted in
    the ancient mythology of the Samudra Manthan—a cosmic battle between the gods and demons over the nectar of immortality.
    
    
    Spanning from January 14 to February 26, 2025, the Kumbh Mela offers devotees an opportunity to cleanse their sins by
    taking a ritual dip at the Triveni Sangam, where the Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati rivers meet. The
    celestial alignments during this time are believed to amplify the spiritual energy of the location, making it an
    auspicious period for prayer, meditation, and self-purification.</p>
