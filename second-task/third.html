    <h3>Indian culture</h3>
    <p>is the heritage of social norms and technologies that originated in or are associated with the ethno-linguistically
      diverse India, pertaining to the Indian subcontinent until 1947 and the Republic of India post-1947. The term also
      applies beyond India to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to India by immigration,
      colonisation, or influence, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. India's languages, religions, dance,
      music,
      architecture, food, and customs differ from place to place within the country.
    The Kumbh Mela is not just a festival—it’s a monumental gathering of spirituality, faith, and cultural unity. In 2025,
    millions of devotees from around the world will converge at Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, to partake in the Maha Kumbh
    Mela,one of the most significant religious events in Hinduism. This sacred event occurs every 12 years and is rooted in
    the ancient mythology of the Samudra Manthan—a cosmic battle between the gods and demons over the nectar of immortality.
    
    
    Spanning from January 14 to February 26, 2025, the Kumbh Mela offers devotees an opportunity to cleanse their sins by
    taking a ritual dip at the Triveni Sangam, where the Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati rivers meet. The
    celestial alignments during this time are believed to amplify the spiritual energy of the location, making it an
    auspicious period for prayer, meditation, and self-purification.</p>
